- In addition to the ASA, we implemented network wide Cisco Umbrella (OpenDNS) DNS to detect malicious activity at the source on our network.
- Umbrella also was chosen to ensure end-user compliance on our network by restricting access to timewasting and adult sites.
- Umbrella further selected due to its ability to block systems such as DNSVPN and Crypto-mining Applications.

Splunk

- Splunk has been proven to lower companies risks of data breaches and fraud due to its complex searching and visualization platform.
- Umbrella further selected due to its ability to block systems such as DNSVPN and Crypto-mining Applications.
- Splunk hooked in to rsyslog and AWS to provide logging on various network datapoints.

Amazon Web Services
------------

We chose to implement AWS.

Method
^^^^^^
- Amazon Web Services was chosen due to its logging integration with Cisco Umbrella which was then forwarded to our syslog server by a custom written script to send the data to Splunk.

Pen Testing Tools
------------

We chose to implement a wide array of penetration testing tools to further our knowledge and research.


DVWA
------------

We chose to implement the Damn Vuln. Web Application to test and research how pen testing tools operate.
