Cisco Umbrella DNS Setup
====
1. Create a trial on umbrella.cisco.com
2. Pointed network DNS to umbrella network and verified connection.
3. We then set up basic rules to allow traffic to pass or be blocked at the DNS level.
4. Then we tested that the DNS filtering is successful. 
5. Then we set up Umbrella to log in to a Cisco Owned AWS S3 Bucket which will then be pulled down and fed into Splunk
